Description:
    Final Project for STAT6210
    This package provides functions for supervised binary classification 
    using logistic regression. It includes methods to compute initial coefficients, 
    calculate bootstrap confidence intervals, and generate confusion matrices 
    with associated performance metrics. Users can input their own datasets and 
    specify predictors and response variables dynamically.
